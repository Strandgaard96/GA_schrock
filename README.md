# GB-GA for the Schrock catalyst

Repository for the paper [Genetic algorithm-based re-optimization of the Schrock catalyst for dinitrogen fixation](https://peerj.com/articles/pchem-30/).
The GA implementation is based on the [GB_GA](https://github.com/jensengroup/GB_GA).

### Note

This codebase is slightly outdated for the work we do on catalyst design with GAs. For the interested, this is a more robust codebase we are currently using for catalyst design: [catalystGA](https://github.com/juius/catalystGA). And for other updated work on the Schrock catalyst see: [genetic_algorithm_for_nitrogen_fixation](https://github.com/jensengroup/genetic_algorithm_for_nitrogen_fixation/tree/main)

1. [Driver function arguments](driver-function-arguments)

## How to run

For simple use of the GA install with conda install the env file.

```
conda env create --file environment.yml
```

To run the GA activate the relevant environment and run the following for a quick run on a local installation:

```
python GA_schrock.py --supress_amines --debug --average_size 10 --size_stdev 2 --scoring_func rdkit_embed_scoring_NH3toN2 --cpus_per_task 2 --population_size 3 --mating_pool_size 4
```
